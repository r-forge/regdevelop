Description: Calculates relevance and significance values for
  simple models and for many types of regression models.
  These are introduced in
  'Stahel, Werner A.' (2021)
  "Measuring Significance and Relevance instead of p-values."
  <https://stat.ethz.ch/~stahel/relevance/stahel-relevance2103.pdf>.
  These notions are also applied to replication studies,
  as described in the manuscript
  'Stahel, Werner A.' (2022)
  "'Replicability': Terminology, Measuring Success, and Strategy"
  available in the documentation.
